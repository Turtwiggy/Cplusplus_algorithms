//Can use search tree as both a dictionary, and as a priority queue
//Basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree
//For a complete binary tree with n nodes, such operations run in O(log n) worst-case time.
//If the tree is a linear chain of n nodes, however, the operations take O(n) worst-case time.
// The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to satisfy the binary-search-tree property:
// Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y:key <= x:key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y:key >= x:key.
