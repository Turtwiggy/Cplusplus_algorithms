//Basic operations on a binary search tree take time proportional to the height of the tree
//For a complete binary tree with n nodes, such operations run in O(log n) worst-case time.

// The keys in a binary search tree are always stored in such a way as to satisfy the binary-search-tree property:
// Let x be a node in a binary search tree. If y is a node in the left subtree of x, then y:key <= x:key. If y is a node in the right subtree of x, then y:key >= x:key.

// Insert() is used to add a new node to the current BST. If itâ€™s the first time we have added a node, the node we inserted will be a root node.
// PrintTreeInOrder() is used to print all of the keys in the BST, sorted from the smallest key to the greatest key, by a recursive algorithm known as inorder tree walk.
// Search() is used to find a given key in the BST. If the key exists it returns TRUE, otherwise it returns FALSE.
// FindMin() and FindMax() are used to find the minimum key and the maximum key that exist in the BST.
// Successor() and Predecessor() are used to find the successor and predecessor of a given key. We are going to discuss these later in the upcoming section.
// Remove() is used to remove a given key from BST.
